# Live_Project
This is my first end to end project by following youtube channel.
The project includes predicting AQI or Air quality index using the information gathered from weather website.
The first model created in by using Linear Regression.
AQI is calculated based on chemical pollutant quantity. By using machine learning, we can predict the AQI. AQI: The air quality index is an index for reporting air quality on a daily basis. In other words, it is a measure of how air pollution affects one's health within a short time period.
